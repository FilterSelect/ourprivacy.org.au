          <span class="chunk">Over the last few weeks the scandals and revelations have kept coming. As the scale of the United States' secret surveillance apparatus is slowly being revealed to the world. What we see now is a dragnet spying operation targeting everyone. You, your family, your friends, community groups, religious organisations, activists and political parties from all over the world.</span>
        </p>

        <p> 
          <span class="chunk">Privacy is still a fundamental human right in the information age. It protects our dignity from those who would wish us harm and prevents the state from intruding into our lives. Privacy gives us the freedom to live our lives the way we want to and we need to defend it!</span>

        <p>
          <span class="chunk">Actions are being planned on <strong>July 6</strong> all around Australia. Get involved!</span>
